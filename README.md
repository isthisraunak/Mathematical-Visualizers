Mathematical Visualizers
Mathematical Visualizers is a comprehensive suite of interactive tools designed to explore and illustrate various mathematical phenomena. Built with Python, PyQt5, Matplotlib, NumPy, and fpdf, this project transforms theoretical concepts into engaging, real-time visualizations.

Features
Collatz Conjecture Visualizer: Animates the Collatz sequence with step-by-step updates and elapsed time tracking.
Pi Approximator Multi-Method: Compares Monte Carlo, Leibniz Series, and Nilakantha Series approximations in real time with live convergence plots and PDF reporting.
Fractal Explorer (Mandelbrot): Renders the Mandelbrot set with interactive zoom in/out and reset controls.
Lorenz Attractor Visualizer: 3D simulation of the chaotic Lorenz attractor.
Logistic Map Visualizer: Demonstrates the iterative dynamics of the logistic map.
Van der Pol Oscillator Visualizer: Displays phase-space trajectories for the Van der Pol oscillator.
Fibonacci & Golden Spiral Visualizer: Constructs Fibonacci squares and overlays a golden spiral.
Newton Fractal Visualizer: Renders Newton fractals for f(z) = zÂ³ - 1 with interactive zoom functionality.
Prime Distribution Visualizer: Plots prime numbers up to a specified maximum to reveal distribution patterns.
